# WebGL Line Renderer

A simple, interactive WebGL application that allows users to render a customizable line by adding points on a canvas. Built using vanilla JavaScript and WebGL with no external libraries.

## Features

- **Dynamic Line Width**: Users can set the line width in pixels.
- **Add Points**: Add new line segments dynamically by clicking on the canvas or using a button to add random points.
